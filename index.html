          <summary>TLDR: Despite everything, I despise AI.</summary>
          <p>I major in <b>Business IT</b> with a minor in <b>Machine Learning</b>. Despite this, i am extremely Anti-AI, and i <b>do NOT</b> condone the usage of it in any unnecessary spaces, without consent of the users or people exploited by AI.</p>
          <p>Studying AI and ML in college, i am very aware of its helpful potential, especially in things that <b>does</b> require predictions, such as weather, health, ect. Although i joined the class mostly out of spite, i left it with a profound sense of admiration on how it functions and dissapointment on its current state in our society. despite the stigma, i am sure, and i do believe that there is an ethical way to implement Machine Learning into something that actually benefits people.</p>
          <p><b>However</b> the current usage of AI as of writing is not aimed towards anything good, and rather is instead used to exploit users and artists. And instead of being used to aid people, it is instead used to belittle or manipulate others (IE. Scams, deepfakes, AI Girlfriends), while feeding the ones already knee deep into it with more of the same echo chambers they want to listen to.</p>
          <p>The only way i would feel happy about AI, is if its actually used for what its made of. and it is clearly not. therefore, until the tides change, <b>i do not believe</b> that AI is the future, especially in its current state, and <b>i do not believe</b> that it is of any worth.</p>
          <p>And especially with its current state, where its only existance is to make companies richer, and a seemingly nonsensical race to make it "act like a human" in a desperate attempt of immortality, which in of itself is causing harm for both people and the enviroment, i physically <b>CANT</b> support it in any way.</p>
          <p>By proxy, Empty panel comics, JJJ n' Co, and anyone involved here, does not use any form of AI Imagery, or AI Writing for any of our content, nor do we consent to our works been taken by AI.</p>
